summary: "Deep learning application for automated water quality assessment using YOLO algorithms."
description: |-
  EyeOnWater YOLO is a deep learning application for water quality assessment using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object classification algorithms, integrated with the DEEPaaS API framework for scientific applications.
  
  Water color is one of the most apparent optical characteristics observable to the human eye and serves as a primary indicator of water quality. This helps researchers classify rivers, lakes, coastal waters, seas, and oceans by colour. It can be used for both fresh and saline natural waters.
  
  The system implements a YOLOv8-based architecture specifically adapted for water quality classification tasks. The model utilizes transfer learning from pre-trained computer vision models, fine-tuned on water quality datasets to optimize performance for aquatic environment analysis.
  
  Key features include:
  - Real-time water quality classification using convolutional neural networks
  - RESTful API integration via DEEPaaS framework for scientific workflows
  - Support for multi-spectral image-based water analysis
  - Docker containerization for reproducible deployments
  
  The model can classify water into different quality categories based on:
  - Dissolved organic matter content: Assessment of chromophoric dissolved organic compounds
  - Overall water transparency: Composite measure of water clarity and optical properties
  
  This module provides researchers and environmental monitoring agencies with an automated tool for continuous water quality assessment, supporting ecosystem health monitoring, eutrophication detection, water treatment optimization, and regulatory compliance applications.
